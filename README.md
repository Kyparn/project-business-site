# Business Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

For this week 3 we are going to make a bussniness site with forms, requests and a touch of JavaScript. 
## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

In the start of the week everything was going well but ofcourse i took water over my head and had some problem with my hero video, all of time on goggle and SO helpt me also fix the JS :)

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
